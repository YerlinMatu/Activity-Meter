# Server sum | Socket | WebApp
We are creating an activity meter which sums random nonsense measures Build​ ​a​ ​Basic​ ​Web​ ​App it should show a realtime graphic better if it uses html5 but can be anything you want, that graphic should display numbers from 0 to 100 in y Axis and time in seconds un X Axis, this graph should update every second from the data provided by a sum server Bonus: It should add lines for every sum server registered to the web app in the case you support multiple server registrations
